-- D9 follow-up: TenantCredential was created by migration
-- 20261101000600_tenant_credential, AFTER the 20261101000400_rls_coverage
-- block ran, so on both the live database and any fresh install it has no
-- tenant-isolation policy. Coverage must be re-checked whenever a new
-- tenant-scoped table lands (the rule documented in src/lib/tenant-context.ts);
-- this migration re-runs the same idempotent block to bring coverage back to
-- every tenant table.
